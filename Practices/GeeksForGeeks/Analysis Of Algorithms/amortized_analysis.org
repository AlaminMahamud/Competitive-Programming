#+TITLE: amortized_analysis
amortized analysis is used for algorithms where an occasional operation is very slow, but most of the other operations are faster.
In amortized analysis, we analyze a sequence of operations and gurantee a worst case average time which is lower than the worst case time of a particular expensive operation.

* Example:
+ Hash Tables
+ Disjoint Sets
+ Splay Trees
