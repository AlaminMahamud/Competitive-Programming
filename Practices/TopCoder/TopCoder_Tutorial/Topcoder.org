#+TITLE: Topcoder Tutorials
* The importance of algorithms
** Introduction
** Runtime analysis
Since the exact speed of an algorithm depends on where the algorithm will run, as well as the exact details of its implementation,
computer scientists typically talk about the runtime relative to the size of the input. For example, if the input consists of N integers, an algorithm might have a runtime proportional to N^2, represented as
O(N^2).
