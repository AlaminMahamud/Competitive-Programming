#+TITLE: NP-completeness
* can all computation problems be solved by a computer.
NP Complete Problems are a failure story of Computer Science. NP Complete problems are problems 
whose status is unknown. No polynomial time algorithm has yet been discovered for any NP Complete Problem, nor has anybody yet been able
to probe that no polynomial-time algorithm exist for any of them. The interesting part is, if any one of the NP complete problems can be 
solved in polynomial time, then all of them can be solved.
* P 
can be solved by a deterministic turing machine.
* NP 
set of decision problems can be solved by Non-deterministic turing Machine in polynomial time.
P < NP;
* NP-Complete
hardest problems in NP-Set.
a problem L is NP-complete if:
1. L is in NP
   Any given solution for NP-Complete can be verified quickly, but there is no efficient known solution.
2. every problem in NP is reducible to L in polynomial time.
