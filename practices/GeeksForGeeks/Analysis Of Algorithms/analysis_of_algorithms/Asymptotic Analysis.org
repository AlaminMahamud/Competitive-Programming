#+TITLE: Asymptotic Analysis
* Analysis of Algorithms
** Why Performance ?
Performance is like a currency; through which you can buy all the stuffs you cherished for.
** Given two algorithm for a task, how do we find out which one is better?
** Asymptotic Analysis:
In asymptotic analysis we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size.
We calculate how does the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size.
** Does Asymptotic analysis always work?
